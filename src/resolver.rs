//! Name resolution and runAfter graph construction.
//!
//! The resolver is the pass between parser and emitter. It assigns each
//! statement a Power Automate action key (uniqued by suffix when needed),
//! links actions by source order (so the emitter can set `runAfter`),
//! tracks each binding in an environment, and lowers each AST statement
//! into a concrete `ActionKind` the emitter can render directly.
//!
//! Expression resolution happens here: every `Expr::Ref(name)` emitted by
//! the parser is rewritten to either `Expr::VarRef` (pointing at a pax
//! variable) or `Expr::ComposeRef` (pointing at a `let` binding's Compose
//! action key), so the emitter never sees an unresolved reference.
