# paxc — the pax compiler

`paxc` compiles the **pax** DSL into [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/) cloud flow definitions. Write terse, readable code; get the verbose `definition.json` that Power Automate expects. Companion interpreter `paxr` runs the same source locally for fast iteration.

For the full language reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

3.1.0 shipped. Every construct listed in REFERENCE.md is implemented and tested, end-to-end deployment to Power Automate has been validated, and a legacy-format package target lets you import compiled flows directly through the Power Automate portal. Round-trip ingest landed in 3.1.0: `paxc --decode <flow.json>` reads an exported PA flow JSON and writes a `.pax` source file plus a `pa/` folder, so existing flows can be refactored and version-controlled without rebuilding them in the designer.

3.0.0 reflected a strategic reframing of the language: round-trip from existing PA flows is now the primary forward direction. Connector bodies, ParseJson, and any non-default trigger live in JSON files next to the source under a `pa/` folder. pax owns the programmable parts (variables, control flow, expressions); files own the PA-specific parts. The `raw{}` escape hatch and the `trigger ...` syntax are gone, replaced by the file convention.

## Why

The Power Automate browser designer is slow and click-heavy. The underlying flow definition is JSON that's technically hand-editable but structured in ways that fight you: actions are a map keyed by name, dependencies are encoded as a `runAfter` graph, and expressions live inside escaped strings. pax is a small DSL that turns all of that into source code you can actually read and maintain, and `paxc` is the compiler that emits the JSON.

Equivalent pax and JSON for initializing a counter:

```
var counter: int = 1
```

```json
{
  "Initialize_counter": {
    "type": "InitializeVariable",
    "inputs": {
      "variables": [
        { "name": "counter", "type": "Integer", "value": 1 }
      ]
    },
    "runAfter": {}
  }
}
```

The source is shorter, and more importantly, the `runAfter` dependency graph is inferred from source order so you never hand-wire it.

## What pax covers

The language supports typed variables and `let` Compose bindings; assignment and compound assignment; arithmetic, boolean, and string concatenation expressions; member access; `if`/`else if`/`else`, `foreach`, `until`, `switch`, `scope`, `terminate`, and `on <status>` error-path handlers; function calls that pass through to Power Automate's expression language; a `pa <Name>` primitive for any PA-shaped action whose body lives in `pa/<Name>.json` next to the source (connectors, ParseJson, anything PA-designer-shaped); and a `debug()` statement that paxr prints at runtime and paxc strips at compile time.

Triggers are file-based: drop a single `pa/<Name>.trigger.json` next to the source to pick the trigger; without one, paxc generates a default manual ("Button") trigger. Connection references go in `pa/connectionReferences.json` and end up at the flow's top level on emit.

## Installing

Requires Rust (edition 2024, toolchain 1.85+). If you don't have Rust, install it first via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/anderix/paxc
```

This builds both `paxc` and `paxr` and places them in `~/.cargo/bin/`, which should already be on your `PATH` after a standard rustup install.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anderix/paxc
cd paxc
cargo build --release
```

The binaries will be at `target/release/paxc` and `target/release/paxr`.
